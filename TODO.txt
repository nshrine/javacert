Test harness for DB class and network server.

Need to catch RuntimeExceptions from proxy class e.g. when server dies whilst 
client is still connected.

Solution to above:
    Package all remotexceptions as cause of recordnotfoundexception and
    when you catch rnfe check for cause and terminate program with
    dialog if instanceof remotexception.



Unreferenced unlocking method doesn't unlock all records because it could:

lock();
DIE HERE
add cookie to list of locked records

therefore correct cookie not available

Only way to do it, is if server unlocks all records when no more clients...
...but what about if just 1 client dies?

Need a way to unlock on server side without requiring cookie?

AH HA!(?) When the unreferenced method unlocks the dead clients locked
records, the threads waiting to lock get notified and executed then
never unlocked!
