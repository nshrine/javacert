<h2>Starting the Application</h2>
<p>
The URLyBird hotel booking system has 3 modes of operation: network server,
network client and standalone mode. Upon starting the application you will be
presented with a configuration window that enables you to set the operating
parameters of the program.
<div align="center"><img src="images/configuration.jpg"></div>
<p>
The first time you run the program a warning will be displayed indicating that
the program is unable to load settings from a saved configuration file and will
be using default settings. When you run the program it will save your settings
and load them on subsequent occasions so that the configuration dialog will be
pre-loaded with your previous settings.

<h3>Network Server Mode</h3>
<p>
To start the network server type:
<pre>
    java -jar runme.jar server
</pre>
The configuration window will ask for:
<ul>
<li><b>Database File</b> - the database file to use.</li>
<li><b>Server Port</b> - the port number on which the server should listen for
network client connections. The default port is 1099.</li>
</ul>
If the database file is valid and the port you selected is not already in use
then you should see a message informing you that the network server has 
started. On clicking OK on this message the server will run with no further
interaction.
<p>
To stop the server you must either hit CTRL-C in the terminal window that you
started it in or close the terminal window or if you started the process in
the background, kill the corresponding java process.

<h3>Network Client Mode</h3>
<p>
To start the network client type:
<pre>
    java -jar runme.jar
</pre>
The configuration window will ask for:
<ul>
<li><b>Server Host</b> - the IP address or DNS name of the URLyBird network
server to connect to.</li>
<li><b>Server Port</b> - the port number the server to connect to. The default
port is 1099.</li>
</ul>
If the client is able to successfully connect to the specified port on the 
specified host the main window will be displayed. Otherwise, an error message
will be displayed.

<h3>Standalone Mode</h3>
<p>
To start in standalone mode type:
<pre>
    java -jar runme.jar alone
</pre>
The configuration window will ask for:
<ul>
<li><b>Database File</b> - the database file to use.</li>
</ul>
If the database file is valid the main window will be displayed.
